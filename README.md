Create custom facebook events

Don’t know what to do tonight? Bored of repeating the same weekend? Invite your friends to a new, weired and exciting night curated by you and all your mates.

# HOW IT WORKS

Create an event and invite your friends on Facebook.
You start by filling in when and where, this gets hidden from everyone else in the group.
The next person fills in what to drink and that as well gets hidden from everyone.
When every line is filled in a custom poster will be generated based on the desicions every one made.
The poster will be tagged with all your friends, posted on everyone’s Facebook wall and your evenings plan reveled.

# WHY IT WORKS

A fun and engaging tool.
You will get a pre party out of the ordinary.
The poster is easy to share.
Conversation will be built around Eristoff and the night which has been planned.
